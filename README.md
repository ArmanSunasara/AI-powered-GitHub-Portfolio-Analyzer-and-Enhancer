## 📌 Problem

For students and early-career developers, GitHub acts as their primary portfolio.  
However, most profiles fail to communicate real skill, impact, or consistency.

Recruiters often struggle to evaluate:

- Incomplete or missing README files
- Poor repository structure
- Inconsistent commit history
- Lack of real-world project presentation
- No clear indicator of technical depth

As a result, strong developers get overlooked.
